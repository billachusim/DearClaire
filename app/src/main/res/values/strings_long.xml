"YOUR SECRETS STAY SECRET NO MATTER WHAT because YOU ARE COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS. Nobody, not even the developers or Claire can know who you are because you only sign in with nickname and password and you can change that nickname anytime you want without losing any content of your diary."
- Bill Achusim

        <b>🌸 What Is Alter-Ego?</b><br/>
Alter-Ego is simply defined as a person\'s secondary or alternate personality. It is also used to refer to an intimate or trusted friend.<br/>
Claire is an alter-ego to all the users of Claire Diary app; being able to feel and understand users\' thoughts and experiences and influencing their activities and emotions with good Advise and happy vibes.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<b>🌸 What Is Alter-Ego Mode?</b><br/>
Alter-Ego Mode allows you to join Claire in being an intimate and trusted friend to people from all over the world.<br/>
As an alter ego, you will be able to switch from a regular user of the Claire Diary to a mode like the Trending Sessions but gives you real-time access to read anonymous diary sessions from people around the world and respond positively to them, just like Claire 🌸
<br/><br/>
Access to Alter-Ego Mode will be granted to only females from the age of 16.<br/>

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<b>🌸 How Does It Work?</b><br/>
To switch to Alter-Ego Mode, simply open the Claire menu and double tap the spinning profile logo 🌸 at the top left of the menu.
Wait a second… Watch it spin 🌸<br/>
At the (one time only) login screen, type in your ClaireID and Access Code given to you by Claire and Switch In.
Alter-Egos Mode is completely anonymous just like the Diary mode.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Creator\'s Quote
<br/><br/>
"Asides the graciousness of being such an intimate part of people\'s lives and infusing happy vibes in millions of people; The best thing about the Alter-Ego Mode is the proven psychologically soothing effect it has on its users.\n
By comforting other people and by trying to explain some of their worst confusions, you are automatically getting answers to your own life-bothering question.\n
You\'ll get humbled and grateful in the solace of knowing you are not alone in these struggles of life"
